Tweets Testing (tweets_test.py)

-	main
	FULLY FUNCTIONAL
	allows the user to input what words to filter for in the tweets entered as
	words separated by commas (i.e. "little, i,...") which are stored as tuple
	"args". This is unpackaged in the call of function tweet_filter with the
	arguments of (tweets, *args).

	uncomment line 50-51 to see list of filtered tweets

	*more explaination in code comments*

	one short-coming of the code is that it doesn't account for words next to 
	punctuation (i.e. "yummy != yummy.") simply for the sake of rebuilding the 
	tweets with their punctuation present.
